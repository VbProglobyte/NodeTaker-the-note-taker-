# NodeTaker-the-note-taker-
A note taker 

## Description
This assignment is to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

The applicationâ€™s front end has already been created. The job was to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.

##Usage 
Use the NodeTaker to quickly write notes and save them. 

##Installation
 
 - node
 - express
 - npm

 Make sure you have node installed on your computer : https://nodejs.dev/learn/how-to-install-nodejs
